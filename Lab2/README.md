# Lab 2 - Regression using `scikit-learn`

The aim of this lab is to demonstrate the effectiveness of `scikit-learn` by following the simple coding paradigm of having a `fit()`, `predict()` and `transform()` as a part of your main estimator class. This allows us the use of <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html">Pipeline</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_selection.html">Model Selection</a> which reduces our work quite a lot. <br>

Note : Use ds1_{train, valid}.csv for Logistic Regression and ds4_{train, valid}.csv for Poisson Regression.
